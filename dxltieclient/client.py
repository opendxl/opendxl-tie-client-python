        **Reputations**

            The `Reputations` for the file are returned as a Python ``dict`` (dictionary).

            The `key` for each entry in the ``dict`` (dictionary) corresponds to a particular `provider` of the
            associated `reputation`. The list of `file reputation providers` can be found in the
            :class:`dxltieclient.constants.FileProvider` constants class.

            An example reputations ``dict`` is shown below:

            .. code-block:: python

                {
                    "1": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "2120340": "2139160704"
                        },
                        "createDate": 1480455704,
                        "providerId": 1,
                        "trustLevel": 99
                    },
                    "3": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "2101652": "52",
                            "2102165": "1476902802",
                            "2111893": "56",
                            "2114965": "1",
                            "2139285": "73183493944770750"
                        },
                        "createDate": 1476902802,
                        "providerId": 3,
                        "trustLevel": 99
                    }
                }

            The ``"1"`` `key` corresponds to a reputation from the "Global Threat Intelligence (GTI)" reputation
            provider while the ``"3"`` `key` corresponds to a reputation from the "Enterprise" reputation provider.

            Each reputation contains a standard set of properties (trust level, creation date, etc.). These
            properties are listed in the :class:`dxltieclient.constants.ReputationProp` constants class.

            The following example shows how to access the `trust level` property of the "Enterprise" reputation:

            .. code-block:: python

                trust_level = reputations_dict[FileProvider.ENTERPRISE][ReputationProp.TRUST_LEVEL]

            Each reputation can also contain a provider-specific set of attributes as a Python ``dict`` (dictionary).
            These attributes can be found in the :class:`dxltieclient.constants` module:

                :class:`dxltieclient.constants.FileEnterpriseAttrib`
                    Attributes associated with the `Enterprise` reputation provider for files
                :class:`dxltieclient.constants.FileGtiAttrib`
                    Attributes associated with the `Global Threat Intelligence (GTI)` reputation provider for files
                :class:`dxltieclient.constants.AtdAttrib`
                    Attributes associated with the `Advanced Threat Defense (ATD)` reputation provider

            The following example shows how to access the `prevalence` attribute from the "Enterprise" reputation:

            .. code-block:: python

                ent_rep = reputations_dict[FileProvider.ENTERPRISE]
                ent_rep_attribs = ent_rep[ReputationProp.ATTRIBUTES]
                prevalence = int(ent_rep_attribs[FileEnterpriseAttrib.PREVALENCE])

        :param hashes: A ``dict`` (dictionary) of hashes that identify the file to retrieve the reputations for.
            The ``key`` in the dictionary is the `hash type` and the ``value`` is the `hex` representation of the
            hash value. See the :class:`dxltieclient.constants.HashType` class for the list of `hash type`
            constants.
        :return: A ``dict`` (dictionary) where each `value` is a reputation from a particular `reputation provider`
            which is identified by the `key`. The list of `file reputation providers` can be found in the

        **Systems**

        The systems that have referenced the file are returned as a Python ``list``.

        An example ``list`` is shown below:

            .. code-block:: python

                [
                    {

                    },

                    }
                ]

        Each entry in the ``list`` is a ``dict`` (dictionary) containing details about a system that has
        referenced the file. See the :class:`dxltieclient.constants.FirstRefProp` constants class for details
        about the information that is available for each system in the ``dict`` (dictionary).

        :param hashes: A ``dict`` (dictionary) of hashes that identify the file to lookup.
            The ``key`` in the dictionary is the `hash type` and the ``value`` is the `hex` representation of the
            hash value. See the :class:`dxltieclient.constants.HashType` class for the list of `hash type`
            constants.

        :return: A ``list`` containing a ``dict`` (dictionary) for each system that has referenced the file. See the

            The following page provides an example of authorizing a Python client to send messages to an
            `authorization group`. While the example is based on McAfee Active Response (MAR), the
            instructions are the same with the exception of swapping the ``TIE Server Set Enterprise Reputation``
            `authorization group` in place of ``Active Response Server API``:

        **Reputations**

            The `Reputations` for the certificate are returned as a Python ``dict`` (dictionary).

            The `key` for each entry in the ``dict`` (dictionary) corresponds to a particular `provider` of the
            associated `reputation`. The list of `certificate reputation providers` can be found in the
            :class:`dxltieclient.constants.CertProvider` constants class.

            An example reputations ``dict`` is shown below:

            .. code-block:: python

                {
                    "2": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "2108821": "92",
                            "2109077": "1454912619",
                            "2117524": "0",
                            "2120596": "0"
                        },
                        "createDate": 1476318514,
                        "providerId": 2,
                        "trustLevel": 99
                    },
                    "4": {
                        "attributes": {
                            "2109333": "4",
                            "2109589": "1476318514",
                            "2139285": "73183493944770750"
                        },
                        "createDate": 1476318514,
                        "providerId": 4,
                        "trustLevel": 0
                    }
                }

            The ``"2"`` `key` corresponds to a reputation from the "Global Threat Intelligence (GTI)" reputation
            provider while the ``"4"`` `key` corresponds to a reputation from the "Enterprise" reputation provider.

            Each reputation contains a standard set of properties (trust level, creation date, etc.). These
            properties are listed in the :class:`dxltieclient.constants.ReputationProp` constants class.

            The following example shows how to access the `trust level` property of the "Enterprise" reputation:

            .. code-block:: python

                trust_level = reputations_dict[CertProvider.ENTERPRISE][ReputationProp.TRUST_LEVEL]

            Each reputation can also contain a provider-specific set of attributes as a Python ``dict`` (dictionary).
            These attributes can be found in the :class:`dxltieclient.constants` module:

                :class:`dxltieclient.constants.CertEnterpriseAttrib`
                    Attributes associated with `Enterprise` reputation provider for certificates
                :class:`dxltieclient.constants.CertGtiAttrib`
                    Attributes associated with `Global Threat Intelligence (GTI)` reputation provider for certificates

            The following example shows how to access the `prevalence` attribute from the "Enterprise" reputation:

            .. code-block:: python

                ent_rep = reputations_dict[CertProvider.ENTERPRISE]
                ent_rep_attribs = ent_rep[ReputationProp.ATTRIBUTES]
                prevalence = int(ent_rep_attribs[CertEnterpriseAttrib.PREVALENCE])

        :param public_key_sha1: The SHA-1 of the certificate's public key (optional)
        :return: A ``dict`` (dictionary) where each `value` is a reputation from a particular `reputation provider`
            which is identified by the `key`. The list of `certificate reputation providers` can be found in the
