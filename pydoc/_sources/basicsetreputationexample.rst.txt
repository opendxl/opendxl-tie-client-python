Basic Set Reputation Example
============================

This sample demonstrates invoking the McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) DXL service to set the
enterprise-specific `trust level` of a file (as identified by its hashes).

.. note::



    From TIE Server 3.0.0 and above it's recommended for automated integrations to set an External Reputation
    (see :doc:`basicsetexternalreputationexample`) instead of an Enterprise Override.

    Advantages:
        * It will help you differentiate between manual Enterprise Overrides (from ePO UI) from automated
          integrations (from OpenDXL).
        * External Provider reputations will be treated as a fallback, so endpoints will consider it only if there is
          no other reputation for the file. This will reduce the impact of false positives.
        * Files with an Enterprise Overrides are not deleted after its retention period expires, because this information
          cannot be recovered. When files are no longer used, keeping their automatically overridden reputations
          is not practical.

Prerequisites
*************
* The samples configuration step has been completed (see :doc:`sampleconfig`)
* A McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) Service is available on the DXL fabric
* The Python client must be authorized to send messages to the ``/mcafee/service/tie/file/reputation/set``
  topic which is part of the ``TIE Server Set Enterprise Reputation`` authorization group.

  The following page provides an example of authorizing a Python client to send messages to an
  `authorization group`. While the example is based on McAfee Active Response (MAR), the
  instructions are the same with the exception of swapping the ``TIE Server Set Enterprise Reputation``
  `authorization group` in place of ``Active Response Server API``:

Running
*******

To run this sample execute the ``sample/basic/basic_set_reputation_example.py`` script as follows:

    .. parsed-literal::

        c:\\dxltieclient-python-sdk-\ |version|\>python sample/basic/basic_set_reputation_example.py

If the `set reputation` operation succeeds the following message will be displayed:

    .. code-block:: python

        Succeeded.

Details
*******

The majority of the sample code is shown below:

    .. code-block:: python

        # Create the client
        with DxlClient(config) as client:

            # Connect to the fabric
            client.connect()

            # Create the McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) client
            tie_client = TieClient(client)

            # Set the Enterprise reputation for notepad.exe to Known Trusted
            tie_client.set_file_reputation(
                TrustLevel.KNOWN_TRUSTED, {
                    HashType.MD5: "f2c7bb8acc97f92e987a2d4087d021b1",
                    HashType.SHA1: "7eb0139d2175739b3ccb0d1110067820be6abd29",
                    HashType.SHA256: "142e1d688ef0568370c37187fd9f2351d7ddeda574f8bfa9b0fa4ef42db85aa2"
                },
                filename="notepad.exe",
                comment="Reputation set via OpenDXL")

            print("Succeeded.")

Once a connection is established to the DXL fabric, a :class:`dxltieclient.client.TieClient` instance is created
which will be used to communicate with the TIE DXL services.

The enterprise-specific `trust level` is established for the file by invoking the
:func:`dxltieclient.client.TieClient.set_file_reputation` method of the :class:`dxltieclient.client.TieClient`
instance along with the `hash values` used to identify the file.

The ``filename`` and ``comment`` are optional, but are useful in identifying the particular file that is associated
with the hashes (especially if the file did not previously exist in the TIE repository).
