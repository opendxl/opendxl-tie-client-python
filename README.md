## Overview

The [McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange](http://www.mcafee.com/us/products/threat-intelligence-exchange.aspx) (TIE) DXL Python
client library provides a high level wrapper for the TIE [Data Exchange Layer](http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx)
(DXL) API.

The purpose of this library is to allow users to access the features of TIE (manage reputations, determine where a file has executed, etc.) without having to focus on lower-level details such as TIE-specific DXL topics and message formats.
